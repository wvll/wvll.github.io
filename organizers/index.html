        <strong>Fuad Rahman:</strong> Fuad Rahman, Ph.D., is an academician and
        entrepreneur, known for founding Apurba Technologies, a company
        specializing in machine learning applications. He also holds the
        position of Adjunct Professor at the Department of Biomedical
        Engineering (BME) at the University of Arizona, which focuses on
        interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer vision,
        medicine, and engineering. This position is aimed to enhance the
        exchange of information and ideas between academia and industry,
        facilitating research collaborations, and developing funding
        opportunities. Apurba Technologies is very active in the computerization
        of Bangla - the seventh most popular language by a number of speakers
        but unfortunately a low-resource language because of a lack of research
        and commercial solutions in this language. Apurba is currently building
        the first-ever commercial Bangla OCR and a screen reader system for
        computer and mobile platforms that will produce output speeches in
        Bangla language under a contract from the Information and Communication
        Technology Division of the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications, and
        Information Technology of the Government of Bangladesh.<br />
        Fuad has published widely in scientific journals. His published body of
        work comprises over 100 technical peer-reviewed articles in the
        scientific literature including 6 book chapters and 30 journal papers.
        He has worked on the editorial boards of technical journals, acted as a
        referee to many journals, and worked as a technical committee member at
        many international conferences.
